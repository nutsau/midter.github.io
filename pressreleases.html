The EU’s State of the Union address is an annual speech given by the President of the European Commission to the European Parliament plenary session in September. Introduced by the Lisbon Treaty, the State of the Union address traditionally kick-starts the dialogue with Parliament and Member States on the political priorities and legislative plans for the following year. The address is followed by a general debate on the State of the Union.

In his 2015 State of the Union speech President Juncker called in particular for unity and solidarity in response to refugee crisis.

The first State of the Union address was given on 7 September 2010.
